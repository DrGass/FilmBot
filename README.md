# FilmBot
Pet project. Bot used to create and resolve voting on films. I made it to help my friends decide on what we're watching tonight.

# Things to change

- Change the system of saving data from files to PostGre database

# Things to add 

- Connection to Database trough external IP
- Make a Django webapp for easy user control
- Make a small desktop app for users that'll want to use the bot on their own server with their own local film database
